# Phone-Aware Low-Frequency Masking (PALF)

This repository contains the code and experiments supporting my MSc thesis at the University of Groningen. The project introduces **phone-aware low-frequency masking (PALF-Mask)** as a data augmentation method to improve **whispered and normal speech recognition** using fine-tuned versions of OpenAIâ€™s Whisper model.

### ðŸ”— Hugging Face Model

The final model fine-tuned with the **F0-Mask** policy is available on Hugging Face:
